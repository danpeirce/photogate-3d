# Photogate

## Component holders

The component holders provide a support to hold components in possition in the correct orientation consistently.
STL files created by Micheal Chernoff using solidworks.

### IRED holder

The first component holder is for the IR emitting diode.

### Signal on DSO

Signal obtained when picket fence was dropped through photogate.
The Picket fence was released from rest in a position where the photogate 
beam was between the leading bumper and first black strip.
